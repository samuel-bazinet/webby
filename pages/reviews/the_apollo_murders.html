        Space is not new to Chris Hadfield, having been in orbit 3 times aboard 2 vehicles, spending many moons orbiting the blue marble. But he has never been on the Saturn V, nor has he been to the Moon. This does not stop him from bringing us along on this thriller based on these elements. Hadfield uses his immense space knowledge and connections to tell a story filled with technical details making us experts of the Apollo program.

        In a barely fictitious 1973, the US is getting ready to launch Apollo 18 as the last lunar mission. What the public doesn’t know is that this mission has military implications targeting the Soviets’ military and space ambition. Based on real missions, people, and spacecraft, this alternate history is filled with twists and turns, betrayal, and an engaging plot where you are never sure what will happen next.

        The characters are, for the most part, quite flat and experience no to very little growth. This is not a slight against the novel as the story does not demand it. Hadfield’s approach to more complex characters is to have them keep their cards hidden from others, keeping the reader guessing as to what they will do next. While there is a definite main character, they are not the ones driving most of the actions. If anything, they are merely a bystander surrounded by chaos and mystery. Hadfield does let us peer into the minds of the characters doing the action, keeping us in the loop as they explain their thoughts and decisions.

        As 1973 is deep into the Cold War, Russia and the Soviets are often portrayed in a more sinister light. This isn’t to say that they are the only or main antagonists in this story; most characters are personally motivated and both countries have their own nasties and pleasantries. This does occasionally put the reader in an interesting situation where they aren’t sure who they should be rooting for.

        This being Hadfield’s first dive into the thriller genre, he does follow common tropes to drive the plot or inform the reader of what will come. Some plot points will come as no surprise, but there are plenty of occasions where the action comes out of left field and the reader is thrown into an exciting chain of events. The pacing is generally quite slow to highlight everything that is going on, but the ending does speed up way too much, making it feel quite rushed.

        This novel is absolutely worth reading, even if you are not into space at all. Hadfield will walk you through what is happening and you may end up finding more to like about spaceflight and appreciate its complexities. This is also the first book in a series, making quite the opening of a thrilling alternate history space epic.
