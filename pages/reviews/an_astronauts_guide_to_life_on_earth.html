        After retiring from being a CSA astronaut, Chris Hadfield blessed us with a novel going over lessons and anecdotes from his life, focusing on his astronaut career. While the title seems to reference this being some kind of guidebook for life, and that is a big aspect of it, it is mostly an autobiography of Hadfield with his thoughts.

        Starting off with his childhood. Hadfield has always been a very motivated person, especially compared to the competitive procrastinator that I am. He saw the landing on the Moon and from that point on, he focused his entire life on being an astronaut. He went on to sturdy mechanical engineering at military school, then proceeded to become a test pilot, all driven by his perception that this is what NASA (and CSA) were looking for in astronauts. He accomplished his goal and got chosen to be an astronaut, but this is only the beginning of a new adventure for him.

        An important lesson Hadfield pointed out is that being an astronaut is a life of endless learning and training. There are many systems to know, many possibilities, and no room for “winging” things. Astronauts, and as he argues, anyone, should be prepared for any situation you know you might end up in. It would be silly to be given an opportunity and act as if you will figure everything out as you do it. Very little is left to fate, even what to do after death is planned and prepared to keep the mind as clear as possible. And no need to be an astronaut to take advantage of this. Although Hadfield’s immense motivation is definitely distracting him from the fact that many people are not nearly as motivated as he is and will happily coast through life.

        In this spirit, Chris emphasizes how important it is to “sweat the small stuff”. It may seem like all the small things we do in life are trivial with little impact, but a single mistake is often the cause of many issues. The lesson here is to be good at the small stuff. Keep them simple to not develop more problems. Hadfield also went over team building and how important it is to be able to work with people and find people that you can work with, especially if you will be locked with them for many months without an easy way out.

        The second section of this book goes over his last mission to space, during expedition 34/35. While this section is much less about lessons, Hadfield goes over his life in the orbiting laboratory. He goes into some amount of details on his day to day life, but then goes into extra details on how urine samples are collected, and how messy they are. Not many lessons are given in this section and it is mostly anecdotes but it is good reading. Hadfield is great at narrating his tasks in an entertaining way.

        The last section goes over his return back on Earth after the mission. He goes over how difficult it was to rehabilitate and do all the tests needed to satisfy the science. This goes back to his earlier point where an astronaut’s job is not just going to space, but also all the things to do before and after. To that point, Hadfield comments on how he finds life on Earth to not be worse than in space. Many people asked him if he thought it would be the end since he was retiring, but he wants to keep doing new things and enjoy the rest of his life with new adventures, being an astronaut was just another chapter in his life.

        This book is great reading for anyone interested in the life of an astronaut. Chris  shares many interesting anecdotes and provides very good advice to maximize your life to get into as few trouble as possible while also enjoying yourself to the max. Hopefully you get to find a physical version to keep as a reference.
